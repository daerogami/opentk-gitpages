#### What platforms are supported?
Windows, Linux, OSX, Android and iOS.

#### Which version is the official one?
[https://github.com/opentk/opentk/](https://github.com/opentk/opentk/ "The official OpenTK repository")

#### How does this relate to the Xamarin OpenTK?
The Xamarin version is a fork of an ancient version.
You should prefer this where possible.

#### How can I get it?
Add the NuGet package to your project.

#### Who uses OpenTK?
OpenTK is used by numerous scientific renderers and games.

### How fast is OpenTK?
For a .Net library, OpenTK is very fast. It uses hand-optimized IL assembly to minimize overhead when calling OpenGL functions. However, keep in mind that the underlying runtimes (.Net/Mono) use garbage collection which introduces some unique performance considerations - refer to our documentation for more information. We place significant emphasis on performance, so please open an issue if you believe something could run faster!

### What kind of abstraction does OpenTK provide?
The Open Toolkit mirrors the raw OpenGL API, with the addition of type-safe enums. This was a conscious design decision that ensures high performance, easy translation of C/C++ code, and beyond that, matches the OpenTK philosophy of being a toolkit, rather than a framework or engine.

#### How do I use this?
1. Add the NuGet Package to your project
1. Open the appropriate namespace
1. Start coding
